            <p>Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
                <br>But I'm only going to get this one chance (six minutes-, six minutes-)
                <br>Something's wrong, I can feel it (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
                <br>Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what
                <br>If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
                <br>And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
                <br>You are just what the doc ordered</p>
            <p>I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
                <br>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
                <br>Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
                <br>They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot</p>
            <p>But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
                <br>I got a laptop in my back pocket
                <br>My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
                <br>Got a fat knot from that rap profit
                <br>Made a livin' and a killin' off it
                <br>Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
                <br>With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
                <br>I'm an MC still as honest
                <br>But as rude and as indecent as all hell
                <br>Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with</p>
            <p>This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
                <br>You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
                <br>With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
                <br>Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
                <br>And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
                <br>I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
                <br>Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
                <br>Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
                <br>How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
                <br>Feel my wrath of attack
                <br>Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
                <br>It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
                <br>While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece</p>
            <p>'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
                <br>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
                <br>Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
                <br>Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
                <br>Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I&#34; have got</p>
